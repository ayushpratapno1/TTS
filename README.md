# Text-to-Speech (TTS) System

A Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that converts written text into natural-sounding speech. This repository provides an implementation for generating audio from text input using deep learning techniques or traditional TTS libraries.

## Features

- Convert text to natural-sounding speech
- Support for multiple voices and languages
- Adjustable speech rate, pitch, and volume
- Command-line interface for easy usage
- Python API for integration into other projects
- Support for various audio output formats (WAV, MP3)
- Real-time text-to-speech conversion
- Batch processing capabilities

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ayushpratapno1/TTS.git

cd TTS


Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt


For advanced TTS models, you may need additional dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install espeak espeak-data
pip install pyttsx3


## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the TTS system with text input:

python tts.py --text "Hello, this is a test of the text-to-speech system."


### Command Line Options

- `--text`: Input text to convert to speech
- `--output`: Output audio file path (default: output.wav)
- `--voice`: Voice selection (male/female)
- `--rate`: Speech rate (default: 150)
- `--volume`: Volume level (0.0 to 1.0)
- `--language`: Language code (en, es, fr, etc.)

### Python API Usage

from tts import TextToSpeech

Initialize TTS engine
tts = TextToSpeech()

Convert text to speech
tts.speak("Hello, world!")

Save to file
tts.save_to_file("This is a test message.", "output.wav")


### Batch Processing

Process multiple text files:

python batch_tts.py --input_dir ./texts/ --output_dir ./audio/


## Supported Features

- **Multiple TTS Engines**: Support for various TTS backends (pyttsx3, gTTS, Coqui TTS)
- **Voice Customization**: Different voices, accents, and speaking styles
- **Audio Processing**: Post-processing for enhanced audio quality
- **Real-time Synthesis**: Live text-to-speech conversion
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file to customize settings:

{
"voice": "english",
"rate": 150,
"volume": 0.9,
"output_format": "wav",
"quality": "high"
}


## How It Works

The TTS system processes text through several stages:
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing input text
2. **Phonetic Analysis**: Converting text to phonetic representations
3. **Audio Synthesis**: Generating audio waveforms from phonetic data
4. **Post-processing**: Enhancing audio quality and applying effects

## Use Cases

- Accessibility tools for visually impaired users
- Educational applications and e-learning platforms
- Voice assistants and chatbots
- Audio book generation
- Announcement systems
- Language learning applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Audio libraries (pyaudio, sounddevice)
- TTS engines (pyttsx3, gTTS, or custom models)
- Optional: GPU support for advanced models
